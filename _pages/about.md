<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Engineering at Westlake University, jointly with Zhejiang University (ZJU), under the supervision of [Prof. Peidong Liu](https://ethliup.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai JiaoTong University (SJTU) in 2022.

My research interests center on core applications within the field of 3D vision, including <b>3D Content Generation</b>, <b>Feedforward 3D Reconstruction</b>, <b>World Models</b>.  I am particularly passionate about developing efficient and scalable algorithms that bridge the gap between digital representation and real-world understanding, with the aim of enabling more intelligent and interactive 3D systems.

I am always eager to exchange ideas and explore potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in my work or have related research topics to discuss.
